# Grotte étrangère
This is a simple **markdown static site generator** blog made using duck tape and glue!

All the generation code is in `Main.hx` and is written in haxe using the `markdown` lib available in haxelib. Made as a simple 1 day project instead of trying to figure out other static site generators (which could have been simpler and better but i digress).
