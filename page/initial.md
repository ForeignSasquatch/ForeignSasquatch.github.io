# Greetings.
Welcome to my _"blog"_. I will be talking about random books, programming stuff and games (and maybe my random ramblings about life) on this blog when i feel remember i have this :p. This actually is just a 2 day project to make a simple static generator and i feel like i should continue it. I guess i might as well do a quick intro about myself. I am a hobbyist programmer who uses the haxe programming language mostly and raylib as a graphics lib. I try to make games and am currently working on a project which should be actually released! (i'll post on that too (for no one to read lol!)) and i also do random projects like this from time to time. Thats it for now, _adios!_
